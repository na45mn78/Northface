	      <dt><b>Jackets:</b></dt>
		  <dd>Some The North Face jackets are warmer than others.<br>
		  It all depends on the kind of thermal insulation used in the jacket.<br>
		  The North Face uses traditional goose down fill for its warmest jackets to keep you warm.<br>

           There are other types of insulation available too, including Thermoball,<br>
           an innovative technology developed in partnership with Primaloft®, as a low weight, <br>
           warm alternative to traditional down fill. <br>
           Thermoball has other benefits as well, <br>
           retaining insulation even when wet and, handily,<br>
           it can be packed down to a small, pocketable size.</dd>

		     <dt><b>Caps:</b></dt>
			 <dd>If you're going out in the sun,<br>
			 you don't need an outback hat to give you some shade.<br>
			 While you might dress up your little one in a bucket hat to keep off the sun,<br>
			 you can get shade from a baseball hat. <br>
			 It offers a visor to shade your eyes without fighting the wide brim of a sun hat.<br>

In cooler weather, turn to our Fleeski 5 Panel.<br>
 Made with warm fleece, it calls to mind the vintage look of a newsboy or ivy cap.<br>
 Our Gordon Cap also offers more warmth than a standard ball cap.<bR>

So what is the warmest men's winter hat for when the weather turns chilly?<br>
 Check out our Men's Beanies for cold weather.</dd>

		 <dt><b>All Stars:</b></dt>
		 <dd>For teenage boys All Stars are endorsed through prominent sporting figures.<br>
		 For the age 40 and above, market price and <BR>
		 style are still the most important factors, going for a ‘classic’ look while still<BR>
		 offering colors and patterns considered less conforming on the same style of shoe creates<br>
		 mass appeal to this market. N fact other than personal preference,<BR>
		 conceptions about the brand and personal choice there is almost no reason<br>
		 the All Star can’t appeal to most age groups.<br>
		 As All Stars are the most diverse range of converse sneakers<br>
		 they can be stylish – cheap and have a classic look while remaining at the same price.<br>
		 Geography is also one of the most important demographic factors for Converse All Stars.<Br>
		 Highly populated areas with emphasis on young kids still in school are targeted by Converse</dd>

		  <h2><b>Recommendations on other websites:</b></h2>
		  <p>
Web design is just as important for fashion industry websites<Br>
 as design and style in the retail industry. <BR>
Implementing optimal web design for fashion brands<Br>
 can incite loyalty, trust, and security for users<br>
 <br>
 The importance of web design lies in this:<br>
 if a brand doesn’t have an excellent online presence,<br>
 they’ll lose a significant amount of their market share and <br>
 make way for its competitors. Retail brands<Br>
 (makeup, clothing, accessories, jewellery, etc.) <br>
 need to pay special attention because design reigns supreme in this space.<BR> 

Brands target a susceptible market where consumers often<br>
 buy based on their attraction to a particular product that<br>
 meets their tastes and preferences. A website’s aesthetic can<br>
 influence many users’ purchasing decisions,<br>
 motivating experts to bet on high-quality product images<br>
 to make their fashion web page design shine</p>
